# Dear applicant,

You might have landed on this page because you want to apply at chatchamp for an engineering position (good ðŸ˜€) or because you got rejected after writing an application email to us (not so good, but still helpful ðŸ˜¬).

Below are some points to consider before applying at chatchamp:

## cover letter
- some words expressing why you are interested in working for chatchamp are enough, but it's always interesting to know why you want to work for chatchamp and not some other company
- if you don't write anything and just send us your CV, why should we assume that you even really *want* to work with us

## CV
- short and concise (1-3 pages)
- attached in PDF format or link to updated LinkedIn profile
- no attached Word documents

## experience
- we are more interested in your potential and prefer when somebody knows more than one programming language; if your experience so far is limited to 1-2 languages that are not relevant to us, this might be a deal-breaker
- we want to see that you have worked for one company over a longer period of time or are willing to do so

## remote requirements
- 6 hours of overlap with our time zone (CET)
- willingness to come to Munich for 2 weeks to get to know the company and the team
--> for that reasons we usually only consider (remote) applicants who are based in Europe or Africa

Thanks for taking the time to read.
Feedback is always welcome.

Best,
Dominik
